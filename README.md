# Requirements
JRE/JDK With JavaFX
[I Recommend This Version](https://www.oracle.com/ca-en/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html)

# How to use the application.
When you have a Java Runtime Enviroment. Double click the SpotiSaber jar file. Once opened input a playlist into the text input then hit go! A prompt will come up asking for you auth the spotify application, click download and all of the songs will begin downloading from your default browser!

# Known Issues
## Not Responding
Yes, I'm aware the app freezes. For whatever reason at the moment, the Java FX Web View library we're using cannot update when background tasks (The Spotify and Beatsaber API Calls) are in progress. We are looking to fix this eventually, but it isn't software breaking.

## Playlist 100 Song Limit
I'm not too sure what's causing this, but we are looking to find it as soon as possible!
